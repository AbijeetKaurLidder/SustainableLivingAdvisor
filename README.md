Creating Your Space: Initiate a new space by clicking on 'Create New Space'. It’s important that the name of your Space reflects the chatbot's role, as it helps in identifying the application’s purpose at a glance.

Configuring Your Chatbot:

Selecting the Framework and Model: Choose 'Gradio' as the framework for its user-friendly interface capabilities, and select a suitable model, such as 'Zephyr 7B', known for its versatility across various tasks.
Customization: Personalize the chatbot to interact as a Sustainable Living Advisor. Tailor system messages and interaction style to provide eco-friendly advice, sustainable living tips, and suggestions for reducing environmental impact.
Deployment: Once setup is complete, deploy your chatbot by simply clicking the create button. Deployment usually takes a couple of minutes. After this, your chatbot will be up and running and ready to interact.
